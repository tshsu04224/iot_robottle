# RoBottle - The Smart Drinking IoT Device
## Project Overview
Robottle is a Smart Drinking IoT device designed to encourage healthy hydration habits. Using a Raspberry Pi Zero 2W and a range of sensors, the device monitors water quality, water levels, and user drinking behavior. It delivers real-time updates and reminders through a LINE bot interface, ensuring users stay hydrated. Additionally, the system prompts users to drink water after extended periods of inactivity, helping to maintain regular hydration throughout the day.
