# RoBottle - The Smart Drinking IoT Device
## Project Overview
Robottle is a Smart Drinking IoT device designed to encourage healthy hydration habits. Using a Raspberry Pi Zero 2W and a range of sensors, the device monitors water quality, water levels, and user drinking behavior. It delivers real-time updates and reminders through a LINE bot interface, ensuring users stay hydrated. Additionally, the system prompts users to drink water after extended periods of inactivity, helping to maintain regular hydration throughout the day.
## Features
Water Intake Tracking: Monitors water consumption using an ultrasonic sensor.
Water Quality Monitoring: Measures Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) using a TDS sensor.
Hydration Reminders: LED reminders to prompt drinking after an hour of inactivity.
Web Interface: Displays data via LINE Bot.
Tilt Detection: Detects when the bottle is tilted using an accelerometer to infer drinking activity.
